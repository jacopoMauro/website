Aeolus is an ANR funded research project whose main objective is to tackle
the scientic challenges that need to be solved in order to bridge the gap
between Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service solutions,
by developing theory and tools to automate deployment, recon figuration,
and upgrades of variable sized, non-homogeneous machine pools.

Position: principal investigator of the Advanced Solving and Planning
task. Responsible for the designing of the deployment action planner and
automatic configuration generator and their complexity studies.
