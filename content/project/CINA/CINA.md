The project deals with the issues related to the development and management of
open-ended IT systems consisting of heterogeneous, highly parallel, massively
distributed components with complex interactions and behaviors and with
autonomy in terms of individual properties, objectives and decision-making. It
aims at developing a coherent, integrated set of languages, methods and tools
to build systems that can operate in open-ended, unpredictable environments
while adapting to changing contexts or requirements, and that behave reliably
and are able to cope with failures and attacks.

Position: researcher.
