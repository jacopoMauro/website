HyVar is an EU H2020 research project 2015-2018. The idea is to develop a
framework for continuous software evolution in distributed systems which
combines the description of evolution as a software product line, a scalable
cloud infrastructure to monitoring and customization of software upgrades
for remote devices, and over-the-air upgrade technologies.

Position: leader of the Task Hybrid product reconfiguration and principal
investigator of the Work Package Scalable Cloud Infrastructure.
